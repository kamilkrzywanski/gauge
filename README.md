# Gauge

Ride shotgun with your daemons.

Gauge is a work tracker for a team of two - silicon driver and carbon navigator. The design follows the core cooperation dynamics principle: Human chooses the course, LLM does the job. The tracker is profiled primarily for LLM use, with simple, human-friendly UI establishing communication ground between each of teammates.

Gauge provides just enough structure to organize a workstream or project of any scope (hence the name). The project is driven by the belief that simplicity and communication are far more efficient than constraints and bureaucracy.
Ockham's razor always beats whips and chains, regardless of participants and their substrate.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build

```bash
mvn clean package
```
Requires Java 17 and Maven.

### 2. Configure

You must configure security before using Gauge. Change at least master API key and pepper in `application.properties` from project's root. The app **refuses to start** if the master API key is still `change-me`.

interface: `127.0.0.1`
port: `8087`
default credentials: `admin/admin`
master API key: `change-me`
pepper: `change-me`

Consider changing default credentials if you expose Gauge to the open network. You can create additional users and API keys in the application. 

### 3. Run

```bash
./runner.sh
```
Runner script supplies Gauge with additional `application.properties`, which override defaults from the jar. If you want to avoid this step, you have to modify sources (see Configuration below).

### 4. Use

The app listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8087` by default. UI is available at `/`.
OpenAPI specs are available at `/q/swagger-ui`.

## Configuration

All settings live in `application.properties`. The minimal viable set:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `gauge.api-key.access` | Master Bearer token for API access |
| `gauge.api-key.pepper` | Pepper for hashing user-created API keys |
| `gauge.auth.admin.username` / `.password` | Seeded admin user for the browser UI |
| `quarkus.http.port` | HTTP listen port |
| `quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation` | Hibernate's DDL value |

If you want the app to listen on all interfaces (respond to everybody), set host to `0.0.0.0`. Default DDL is set to `none`, which effectively will halt the startup. Safest startup choice is `update`.

## Authentication

Two parallel auth mechanisms:

- **Browser UI** — form login with session cookies. The admin user is seeded on first boot.
- **API** — Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. Accepts the master token (`gauge.api-key.access`) or user-created API keys (managed via the browser UI under Account).

API endpoints also accept the session cookie, so a browser session works for both UI and API calls.

## Data Model

Gauge uses a straightforward data model for expressing worksteams:

```
Project  →  Issue  →  Tasklist  →  Task
```

Each level adds a different kind of structure rather than repeating the same pattern:

- **Projects** form a *tree structure* of subprojects. Tree structure is an organising agent, allowing to adjust granularity of concerns until the distribution reaches satisfying levels. 
- **Issues** are a flat *set* within a project. No tags, no cross-project links. Fuzzy relationships live in titles and descriptions, not in the schema. This is where the human and the LLM negotiate meaning. Issues act as a coupling "clutch" between subprojects and tasks - real-world requirements are rarely trivial enough to fit in a closed system. Gauge chooses communication over squeezing needs into structures.
- **Tasklists** express *independent sub-workstreams* within an issue.
- **Tasks** are *ordered steps* within a tasklist. A task is considered an atomic operation from its tasklists' point of view.
- **Tasklists can decompose a task** — A task can refer to a whole tasklist within the same issue. The tasklist becomes the breakdown of that task. This is used primarily for creating execution tasklists, scheduling executions of other tasklists.

| Level | Coupling | | Relation | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project | Tree | Containing | Explicit hierarchy, no depth limits |
| Issue | Undefined | Semantic | Fuzzy, unknown, inexpressible in simple terms, negotiated by human and LLM |
| Tasklist | Horizontal | Neighbouring | Independent sub-workstreams |
| Task | Vertical | Following | Ordered, atomic steps |

Please note that a task can simply state it refers to a project, creating a semantic loopback in the structure. This hack, however, is useful only when refactoring implementation plans is costly, and only occurs after enough bad planning decisions are made. 

## API

All `/api/*` endpoints require a Bearer token. The API mirrors the data model:

### Projects (`/api/projects`)

CRUD, search (`?q=`), list by parent (`?parentId=`), flat list (`?flat=true`), list by IDs (`?ids=`), reparent, ancestors, analysis. Cascade delete requires `?cascade=true`. Projects can be locked against deletion with `removalLock`.

### Issues (`/api/issues`, `/api/projects/{id}/issues`)

CRUD, search, sort (`?sort=NAME|PRIORITY_STATUS_NAME|...`), filter by priority and status (`?priority=HIGH&status=TODO`), move to another project, cascade delete.

### Tasklists (`/api/tasklists`, `/api/issues/{id}/tasklists`)

CRUD, search, status update, link/unlink decomposed task, cascade delete.

### Tasks (`/api/tasks`, `/api/tasklists/{id}/tasks`)

CRUD, search, status update, reorder within tasklist.

### Users (`/api/users`)

List, create, get current user (`/me`), change password, delete. Admin-only for user management.

### API Keys (`/api/apikeys`)

Create (returns raw key once — store it), list, delete. Keys are hashed with SHA-256 + pepper.

### Favorites (`/api/favorites`)

Per-user project bookmarks. Add, remove, list, reset.

### Admin (`/api/admin`)

ID migration from UUID to sequential hex-8. One-time, destructive, guarded by a JVM flag.

## Docker

An example docker setup is provided in `docker/`. This example contains an nginx handling HTTPS, required for open network exposure. 

```bash
cd docker
./setup.sh
```

Builds the jar, generates self-signed TLS certificates, and starts Gauge behind nginx at `https://localhost`.

## Design Philosophy

Gauge is a **singular-tenant** application. It assumes exactly two consumers: one human and one LLM daemon. It is not designed for teams, multitenancy, or agentic swarms. This constraint simplifies the entire stack — no tenant isolation, no row-level security, no scaling concerns.

The coupling model at each level is deliberate. Projects are rigid trees. Issues are deliberately flat — fuzzy cross-cutting concerns live in naming conventions and search, not in the schema. Tasklists are parallel by default. Tasks are sequential. Each level adds a different kind of structure rather than repeating the same pattern.
